# Homework 3

`interval.cc` contains my actual definition of the interval transfer functions
for subtraction and bitwise AND over 5 bit signed integers. `test.cc` contains
a test driver that does exhaustive testing of both of the transfer functions.
Na√Øve transfer functions that concretize, perform the transfer, and then abstract
the concrete results are used as test oracles.

## Running the tests

You can run the tests using:

```bash
make
./test -q
```

(the `-q` option just silences a lot of debugging information.)
